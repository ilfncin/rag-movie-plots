      "\"Titanic\" was directed by James Cameron and was released in 1997. The film is a romantic drama that tells the story of a fictional love affair between two characters, Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (played by Kate Winslet), set against the backdrop of the real-life sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912.\n",
      "\n",
      "The narrative unfolds through a combination of a present-day exploration of the wreck of the Titanic and flashbacks to the ship's ill-fated maiden voyage. Jack, a poor artist, and Rose, a young woman from a wealthy family, meet aboard the ship and fall in love despite the constraints of their social classes and the disapproval of Rose's fiancé. The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and class struggle, culminating in the tragic sinking of the Titanic, which serves as a dramatic backdrop to their story. \"Titanic\" was a massive commercial success and won numerous awards, including 11 Academy Awards.\n",
